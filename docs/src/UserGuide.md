# User Guide

This user guide explains how to use [**Mooring.jl**](https://github.com/CMOE-TUDelft/Mooring.jl), a Julia package for modeling and simulation of mooring systems. 

Here we follow a bottom-up approach: from defining points and materials, to segments and lines, and finally running full simulations with different point motions and seabed.
