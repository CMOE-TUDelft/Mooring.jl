## MooringDiscreteModel

The `MooringDiscreteModel` module handles the generation of finite element meshes
for mooring lines.

### Functions

- `generate_discrete_model`: Creates a discrete model for a mooring line
- `generate_line_mesh`: Generates a 1D mesh along a line

These functions are typically called internally by the `setup_lines` function.
